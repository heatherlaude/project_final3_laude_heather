Notes:

- I know on previous projects you mentioned I should use classes instead of IDs.
I was able to do that in most places, but there were a few times when I had to have
an ID in order to make my styles work.  I used them as a last resort.

- My JS file is named main2 because I had to make an edit for the backstretch plugin and my
browser didn't reflect the change on reload, so I renamed the file to force it to reload. Just
didn't want you to think I enjoyed adding random numbers on my filenames. :-)

- I enjoyed this project and I learned a lot this semester.  Thank you!
